- Automation Test - 
Automatic execution of functional tests, designed at least in some ways to simulate human beign executing manual tests

Advantages
- Performing some tests that cannot be performed at all or easily manually
- Reducing the time needed for test execution
- Increase the frequency that some tests can be run
- Reducing mistakes made by testers
- Executing test outside of normal business hours
- Increasing the confidence in the build

Disadvantages
- Delays, Costs, and mistakes associated with testers as they learn new technologies
- In worst cases, complexity may become overwhelming
- Considerable maintenance of tools, enviroments, and test assets required
- The pesticide paradox is increased when automation is used since exactly the same test is run each time
- Without clever programming in the automated tests, tools are literal minden and stupid; Testers are not.

- Web testing vs mobile testing- 
Web Testing
web application is a program delivered through the internet in the form of a browser interface.

Testing Techniques that can be applied to web testing
- Functionality Testing
- Interface Testing
- Compatibility Testing
- Performance Testing 

- How to test Web apps - 
- Test all links in the webpages are working correctly and make sure there are no broken lingks
- Test forms are working as expected
- Test Cookies are working as expected
- Test HTML and CSS
- Test business workflow

 - Mobile testing
 - Native: they are downloaded, installed and updated from supplier stores.
 these apps may need testing all supported devices.
 - Browser based: These are Accessed through a mobile browser and they use a typical web-development technologies and browsers.
 -Hybrid: Hybrid applications are a combination of native and web app.

- How to test mobile apps? -

We need to consider the following specific risks and challenges
- The variety of m obile devices with device-specific defects on some of them.
- The availability of devices in-house or via the use of external test labs.
- The introduction of new technologies, devices and/or platforms during the application life cycle.
- The installation and upgrade of the app itself via various channels, including preserving app data an preferences.
- The ability to test using the networks of varios service providers.
- The use of mobile emulators, simulators and/or real devices for specific test levels and type of test
